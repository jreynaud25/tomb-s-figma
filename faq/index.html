        <span class="title bold">What is a Tomb?</span>
        <p>
        The Tombs are part of a series of drawings of various hard-format data storage media, originally created in 2016 as part of David Rudnick’s Yale MFA thesis project, Atlas. Each Tomb in the series is drawn using the same tools as the originals; Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator CS3, and are drawn entirely using the trackpad of a 2012 Apple Macbook Pro. No 3D software or additional hardware has been used in their construction. Though some Tombs share common components, each is individually and entirely composed, drawn and titled for this series. There are no generative components.
        </p>
        <span class="title bold">What is a House?</span>
        <p>
        The 177 Tombs are divided into 8 Houses. Each House has its own themes, launch mechanics, on-chain behaviours, restrictions, evolutions, and printed and physical components. The specific aspects of the houses and their behaviours are detailed in the Tomb Index. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-col">
        <span class="title bold">Why 177 Tombs?</span>
        <p>
        I wanted a unique, identifiable number large enough for the possibilities of interaction and composition to feel infinite, small enough for every one to matter and for its unique qualities to feel special, and for me to be capable of drawing them all to a standard where no Tomb felt less interesting or compelling than any other.
        </p>
        <span class="title bold">Whats a RONIN? Who are the collaborators?</span>
        <p>
        RONIN are the Tombs of the eighth and final House. Each of the 16 RONIN are collaborations, and recognitions of past collaborations, with some of the people whose work has helped bring my practice to this point, or whose works on chain have helped inspire and establish the benchmarks and paths that this project continues to explore. Each RONIN Tomb is drawn by me but launches as a passenger in a contract deployed by the collaborator. They are diplomats inside embassies, relics inside other territories, distributed language that leaves any contract space this project defines and takes the Tomb Series out into territories defined by other communities, other agencies, other protocols and parameters, non-native to its own logics and goals.
        </p>

    <div class="text-col">
        <span class="title bold">What’s in the Index?</span>
        <p>
        Tomb Index is the definitive catalogue and guide to the Tomb Series. Designed in Terrain, it will be printed with a unique print profile developed specifically for the book, which has involved an 8 colour calibration process. It contains large-format reproductions of all 177 Tombs, detailed breakdowns of each of their elements, plus additional appendices documenting all 177 Disc Surfaces, plus the 19 additional Shield States of the X2 house, and the 19 Shields. It also contains detailed breakdowns of the mechanics and constitution of all eight Houses in the series, an introductory text by David Rudnick, and three special introductory texts by Christopher S. Wood from Forgery, Replica, Fiction, the original text of which is currently out of print, as well as information and details of the series that will only ever be published in the Index itself.
        </p>
        <span class="title bold">How many copies will be printed?</span>
        <p>
        There will be one print run, and the best way to ensure a copy of Tomb Index, and to be among the first to receive it and view the entire series would be to order at presale. The final volume will be determined by pre-sale numbers, but most likely will be presale +20%, allowing for a limited second release later in the year.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-col">
        <span class="title bold">Are numbers limited?</span>
        <p>
        In the past there has been significant secondary market markup for books the studio has designed, so to inhibit scalping we are capping orders at 2 books per customer [we do understand that some people prefer to keep a mint copy separate from an open one]. If you are a bookseller interested in stocking Tomb Index in your store, please send an email to orders@tombseri.es.
        </p>
        <span class="title bold">How will distribution be handled?</span>
        <p>
        Terrain will handle fulfillment of EU and non-US RoTW orders, with DHL as a shipping partner. For all US orders, we’re proud to partner with our friends at Elara Press, who will be fulfilling US distribution. We will update you as fast as possible with the estimated time you will receive your books by email after close of presale. An initial estimate will be made within 48 hours, with further clarifications if necessary. Due to the unavoidable state of global supply chain congestion right now, we estimate a ship date of 8-10 weeks from presale close, with a firmer outline to be communicated with all purchasers as soon as is possible. Until our final presale numbers are known, it is impossible for us to give that figure.
